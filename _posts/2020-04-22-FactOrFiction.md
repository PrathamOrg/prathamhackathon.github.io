**Objective:** Check the scientific validity of a claim linked to COVID-19

**Concept:** To create a scoring tool to assess whether the claim is valid or fake. 

**Issues addressed:** There is rampant spread of misinformation related to the COVID-19 disease and the novel coronavirus. Creating such a tool will aid in separating actual facts from other untrue claims and stop the spread of misinformation.

**Tech Needs:**

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Problem Statements</td>
    <td>Know-how</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Create a list of sources and ascertain the authenticity of each source</td>
    <td>Knowledge of the information dissemination sources</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Create a scraper to search for phrases,keywords or combination of keywords across websites and sources</td>
    <td>Web crawlers/ spiders, search engine bots, Text Mining</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Create a tool which will assign a Fact or Fiction score between 0-100  to the claim after discerning its source and the sourceâ€™s authenticity</td>
    <td>NLP Techniques, ML algorithms, Deep Learning</td>
  </tr>
</table>


**Details:**
The lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic has increased our reliance on the internet for getting information and the news more than ever. Being able to separate fact from hoax is crucial to deal with this without adding further panic to the already uncertain times. Having a system in place where the authenticity of each such claim can be measured will go a long way in stopping the spread of wrong information.
