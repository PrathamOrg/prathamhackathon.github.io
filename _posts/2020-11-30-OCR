**Objective** : Developing an Optical Character Recognition tool to convert the images of answers to text for evaluation

**Concept** : To evaluate answers of students handwritten on paper, the image of the page need to be converted into text. This process can be automated to save the human efforts by using a optical character recongnization tool that converts images to text.

**Project Plan:**

| Step | Know-how | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Project conceptualization: Explore various methods of developing a  custom optical character recognization tool | | Not started |
| Perform the various OCR methods | Image Processing, OCR | Not started |
| Compare the performance and cost of the OCR models to choose the best model | | Not started |
