title: Evaluation of Non-Verbal Communication Skills
---


**Objective:** To develop Video-based Test of Non-Verbal Communication Skills (VTCS)

**Concept:** To develop test tools for the effective and comprehensive assessment of non-verbal communication skills of children

**Issues addressed:** Non-verbal cues frequently reveal the intention of the children and reflect his/her emotional reactions to any topics/subject. Without an automated evaluation tool it is difficult for teachers to identify these non-verbal cues and guide and provide content to children according to their need.

**Tech Needs:**

**Details:**
While the key to success in both personal and professional relationships lies in our ability to communicate well, it’s not just the words that we use but our nonverbal cues or "body language" that speak the loudest. Our facial expressions, gestures, posture, tone of voice, and level of eye contact are powerful communication tools.

Non-verbal cues frequently reveal the intention of the children and reflect his/her emotional reactions. By improving how children understand and use nonverbal communication, we can help them express what they really mean, help them connect better with others, and build stronger, more rewarding relationships.

The Video-based Test of Communication Skills (VTCS) is an innovative, computer-administered test to understand the many different types of nonverbal communication or body language which include:

1. Facial expressions: The human face is extremely expressive, able to convey countless emotions without saying a word.The facial expressions for happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, confusion and disgust are the same across cultures.

2. Body movement and posture: This type of nonverbal communication includes posture, bearing, stance, and the subtle movements children make.

3. Gestures: Children may wave, point, beckon, or use hands when arguing or speaking animatedly, often expressing themselves with gestures without thinking. 

4. Eye contact: Eye contact is also important in maintaining the flow of conversation and for gauging the other person’s interest and response.

5. Voice: It’s not just what children say, it’s how they say it. Their timing and pace, how loud they speak, their tone and inflection, and sounds that convey understanding, such as "ahh" and “uh-huh.” Their tone of voice can indicate sarcasm, anger, affection, or confidence.
