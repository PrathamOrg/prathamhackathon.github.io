tags: [text mining]
---

**Objective** : Developing knowledge graph of educational concepts which can be used to build a video recommendation system

**Concept** : Extract concepts from school textbooks and create a graphical representation of the relationship between these concepts

**Project Plan:**

| Step | Know-how | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Project conceptualization: Explore various methods of building automated knowledge graphs | | In Progress |
| Extract text data from NCERT textbooks to build knowledge graph |  | Done |
| Extract concepts from the textbook data using DBPedia | | Done |
| Relation identification between concepts | | In Progress |
| Evaluation of the knowledge graph | | No started |
| Development of the knowledge graph using the evaluated technique for all subjects | | No started |

**Details** : Knowledge graph serves as an integrated information repository that interlinks heterogeneous data from different domains. A knowledge graph can be created by extracting concepts from school textbooks and finding links between them to create a graphical representation of the concepts. These interlinked concepts can be used to create a recommendation system for online educational videos to recommend videos of relevant topics to students.
