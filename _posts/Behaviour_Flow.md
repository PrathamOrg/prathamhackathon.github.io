title: Creating different personas based on behaviour flows
tags: [behaviour flow]
---


**Objective:** To see if there is a difference between users in different program in how they interact with the Foundation Course App

**Concept:** Create personas based on behavioural flow and find ‘difference’ if any between the personas.

**Issues addressed:**  Understanding how users interact with the app will help us understand typical learning pathways


**Tech Needs:**

<table>

    <td>Problem Statements</td>
    <td>Know-how</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Create personas based on behavioural flow</td>
    <td>Graph traversal logic, creating click maps, traversal algorithms</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Define ‘differences’ in personas based on the nodes covered and path traversed through the behaviour graph</td>
    <td>Clustering, classifications and BFS/DFS graphs</td>
  </tr>
</table>


**Details:**
 Foundation Course is an app developed by Pratham where students can enroll in different courses, understand the content and finally give an assessment for the same. Understanding if and how users interact with the app will allow us to understand the different kinds of study patterns and if students under different programs use the app differently.
