title: Free Text Answer Assessment
tags: [text mining]

**Objective** : To automate assessment of short free text answers

**Concept** : Developing ML model trained based on human-labelled answer evaluation dataset of short free text answers to provide automated assessment

**Issues addressed:** Assessment plays a central role in any educational process, because it is a common way to evaluate the students&#39; knowledge regarding the concepts related to learning objectives. But the expense and logistics of scoring them reliably often present a barrier to their use. Automating the process of evaluating these assessments can help reduce the burden on the evaluators.

**Project Plan:**

| Step | Know-how | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Collection of data on short free text answers to questions using the student assessment app |
 | Done |
| Develop web-portals to evaluate the short text answers to be used for training and evaluating the ML model | Web Development | In-progress |
| Develop and test ML Model to sample free text answers and ground truth as input and corresponding grades/rating as output | Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms, Keyword analysis, natural-language processing and Information mining techniques | In-progress |
| Conceptualize and integrate the designed model with an Android app (Deployment) | Android Development | Not Started |

**Details:**  Automatic evaluation is preferred to manual assessment to avoid monotonic, bias errors and conserves time for other activities. Hence automatic assessment is vital for educational system. Keyword analysis, natural-language processing and Information mining techniques are the main approaches adopted for text assessment.

**Next steps:**

- Implementing short text assessment using semantic similarity between the ground truth and answer by student
