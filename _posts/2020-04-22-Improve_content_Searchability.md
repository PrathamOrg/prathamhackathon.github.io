**Objective:** Improve the searchability of all the content available on the POS website
**Concept:** Classifying and tagging all the content on the POS website based on its attributes like resource type, language, subject, topic, age group etc

**Issues addressed:** Correctly tagging and classifying all the content on the POS website will not only help in improving the search results on the website but also help in curating and archiving the content currently on the website 

**Tech Needs:**

  <tr>
    <td>Implement Elastic Search on the website (dependency on keywords for each resource)</td>
    <td>Text mining, ElasticSearch</td>
  </tr>
</table>


**Details:** POS website currently has all the course related content developed by Pratham for students in different age groups. Correctly tagging each resource based on attributes like the resource type (Eg: video, stories etc), language, subject, topic and age group will help in streamlining the search results on this website and also curate and archive all the content hosted on the website.
