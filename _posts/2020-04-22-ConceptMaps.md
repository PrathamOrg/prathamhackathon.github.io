**Objective:** Create a knowledge graph of interlinked concepts found in the curriculum

**Concept:**  Use existing concept maps like Khan Academy and Wikipedia relevance and evaluate NCERT textbooks to generate a relationship between various terms based on chapter names and occurrence of any other keywords

**Issues addressed:** Creating such concept maps gives an overview of all the different concepts that are there in the textbooks in a more structured and a graphical manner.

**Tech Needs:**

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Problem Statement</td>
    <td>Know-how</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Generate relationships and create concept maps between various terms used in a chapter and other key words in the NCERT textbooks</td>
    <td>Text mining, concept maps</td>
  </tr>
</table>


**Details:**
Creating such concept maps helps students understand the structure and the main concept discussed in a chapter in a quick glance. It helps in understanding complex topics, and understanding the connections between topics through a visual approach which helps in easier retention and recall.
