**Knowledge Graph of**

**Educational Concepts**

**Objective**: Developing knowledge graph of educational concepts which
can be used to build a video recommendation system

**Concept**: Extract concepts from school textbooks and create a
graphical representation of the relationship between these concepts

  Relation identification between concepts                                                               No started
  Evaluation of the knowledge graph                                                                      No started

**Details**: Knowledge graph serves as an integrated information
repository that interlinks heterogeneous data from different domains. A
knowledge graph can be created by extracting concepts from school
textbooks and finding links between them to create a graphical
representation of the concepts. These interlinked concepts can be used
to create a recommendation system for online educational videos to
recommend videos of relevant topics to students.
